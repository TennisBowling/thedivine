# The Divine
A smart contract is allow us to generate and secure pseudo-random numbers and for the lowest cost. All processes and algorithms are transparent and open to everyone. The algorithm is thus safe and acceptable for a wide range of PRNG applications and situations where the cost to manipulate outweigh the transaction value.

# Disclaimer
Do not use this algorithm in gambling and/or use at your own risk. Definitely do not use this algorithm in cryptography.

# What is The Divine?
The Divine is an immortality chain of randomness entropy, which is collected from the nonce of a sender's message . Each sender has a different nonce number they contribute to the entropy chain, thus ensuring a different. All users grow and maintain the immortality chain.

# How to use TheDivine?
