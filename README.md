# TheDivine
The smart contracts allow us to generate pseudo-random number and secure it with lowest cost. All process and algorithm are transparent and open to everyone. Therefor algorithm still safe at acceptable on wirde ranger of PRNG application when cost to manipulate are greater than transaction value.

## Discaimler: Do not use this algorithm in gambling and/or use at your own risk. And surely that, do not use in cryptography.

# What is The Divine?
The Divine is a immotality chain of randomness entropy, which was collected from message sender's nonce. Every sender have different nonce number that why they have recive a different result and contribute their own nonce to entropy chain. All user grownth and maintance immotality chain.

# How does The Divine secure?

Everytime anyone get result from The Divine, they also append their own randomness value to infinity chain. We're call it immotality chain because noone able to modify previous values. When someone call The Divine, The Divine get the last result
